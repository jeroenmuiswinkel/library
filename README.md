## Book Library Application


:busts_in_silhouette: Jeroen van Muiswinkel

This is an example backend of a library that is want to lend books to their clients. In order for this to function well, it is necessary to register all the clients and books into a database. If a client wants to lend a book, the client can make a API request, to reserve the desired book. For the people that work at the library, various API have been made such that clients books and authors can be added, edited deleted or gathered from the  backend.

This project is made using Java Spring Boot. The software is divided into different components:

- Front end (will hopefully be added in the future :construction_worker:)
- API layer
- Service layer
- Data access layer
- Database
